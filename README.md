<h1>Nessus Home Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I learned how to set up Active Directory on my home computer using Oracle Virtual Box.  I went through the process of installing both a Windows 10 client VM and a Server 2019 domain controller VM.  I then installed Active Directory domain services and created a dedicated domain, organizational unit, and administrator account.  Next, I installed and configured the network settings of both VMs to mimic an office environment and ran a PowerShell script to create approximately a thousand users.  At this point, I was able to successfully log on to the Windows 10 client through the domain using the usernames and passwords I added to the server.
